it's a big ol' string of 2 digit numbers by the looks (may be done as hex so idk)

So if you take that big ol' string

from binary turn it into utf 8 (i think)
in utf 8 it is a bunch of morse code
take that morse code and translate it from morse
it gives you a multiple choice

which is

D) REUSING THE SAME PASSWORD ACROSS MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS FOR EASE OF MEMORY
